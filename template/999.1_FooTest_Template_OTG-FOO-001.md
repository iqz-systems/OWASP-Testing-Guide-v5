# Testing for Foo

## Summary

This describes all that is needed for FooTest.

## Test Objectives

Assess whether bars are present by calling foo from a script.

## How to Test

To perform FooTest, you can FooProcess1 and FooProcess2.

### FooProcess1

FooProcess1 involves [obfuscation](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/129296/the-case-for-code-obfuscation) to evade a [SIEM](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/solution-areas/security-and-fraud/siem-security-information-and-event-management.html).

### FooProcess2

The foo test involves an approximated circle as shown below:

## Remediation

- Web/Application servers should be configured with `bar` in order to address foo type vulnerabilities.
- Top 10-2017 A6-Security Misconfiguration.
- ASVS v4 V14 Config.
