# Foo Template Explanation

## Summary

This explains the template files in this project. Each page starts with the title at level H1. Having the title visible in the page allows it to be saved (to note taking apps or bookmarks that show thumbnails) on its own without losing the title.

## Overview

The templates show the following items regarding articles:

- File name
- Use of Headers and Sections in Pages
- Use of Images
- Use of (generally inline) Links

The [999.7_FooTest_Template_OTG-FOO-001.md](999.7_FooTest_Template_OTG-FOO-001.md) is a sample implementation of this template.

### File Name

The file name is as follows:

`<section>.<sub-section>_Article_Name_OTG-[CODE]-[NUMBER].md`

1. Section is only one integer.
2. Subsection can have multiple levels, where each level is in a folder. For example, Chapter 4 has multiple levels of sections. You can refer to that section to check.
3. The article name is in Title_Case separated by the underscore "_". The use of the underscore is to make it easier to encode urls, i.e. to avoid `%20` that looks unsightly in links,
4. Every distinct test has a code, for example: OTG-INFO-001. If you are documenting up a completely new category of test, you may give that its own unique code. Ask around in the Github Issue related to the article you are writing if you are unsure about the code.
5. All text in this project is markdown format (.md).

### Headers and Sections

Most pages, unless they are themselves a summary, have a summary section at level H2 `## Summary` to start the article. The summary is a quick description of the test. Other sections of a page may vary depending on the test. Common sections to use are:

- __Test Objectives__ : Describe properties or vulnerabilities tests can find.
  - Try to start the wording of the test objectives section with with an [imperative mood](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/verbs_voice_and_mood.html). Imperative mood allows the style to be more direct, and it also cuts down on extraneous words when a reader is skimming the introduction. For example, start with a sentence of the form "Assess if *X* can be compromised by performing *Y*".
- __How to Test__ : Describe what a tester is supposed to do if they want to run this test.
  - Break the "How to Test" into multiple subsections at your discretion.
- __References__ : If a lot of the article came from a specification or other long document, you may use a References section. However, try to use [inline-style links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) if possible.
- __Remediation__ : Each section/sub-section should have a short remediation section.
  - Feel free to use bullets to help keep things brief.
  - Strongly consider referencing other OWASP resources such as ASVS, Top 10, Proactive Controls, or the Cheat Sheet Series.

### Use of Images

Images should be placed in an "images" folder at the same level in the directory structure as the page. Caption figures using title case, with the section and sub-section numbers, followed by the figure position in the document. Use the format *`Figure <section>.<sub-section>-<position>: Caption Title`*.

For example, the first image shown in section 4.8, sub-section 19 would be added as follows:

```md
![SSTI XVWA Example](images/SSTI_XVWA.jpeg)\
*Figure 4.8.19-1: SSTI XVWA Example*
```

The images should be numbered by the order they appear in the page, starting at 1. For example, if a page *999.7.2.4* contains three images, the images in that page receive these numbers:

- 999.7.2.4-1
- 999.7.2.4-2
- 999.7.2.4-3

In that same example, if there is one image in the next page 999.7.2.5, it has the ID 999.7.2.5-1.

### Links

As mentioned for headers and sections, [inline-style links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) are favoured in the newer pages of this project. The use of inline links is better for the flow of the document, and it prevents duplicating a link or reference to a resource. (Any time something is duplicated, one of the "duplicates" becomes out of sync with the other one, and that leads to confusion later.) We are going through older sections to change pages that used different styles to link to tools or other guides.
